acessing a repository from online
git clone"adddress"

cd repo

git add .

git commit -m "comment"

git push origin main

making a repository

make a folder
go to folder cd

git init

for pushing link it to online
git remote add origin "link"

//git branching//

each individual branch only notes changes (free area for writing tetsing code)

git branch  ?? checking which branch you are online

git checkout ()   switching branches

git checkout  -b () //new branch


tested git branch

git diff (branch) checking difference between branches

then you can make a pull request online to make changes and merge online and then you can pull changes off line by

git pull origin main

deleteing a branch 
git -d newb
 then delete from remote as well
 git push origin --delete branch_name


merging locally git merge (branch)
git merge master
used to keep track of changes in master while working in branch

resolving merge conflicts
easiiest way is in the code editor

undoing a git
git reset (unstages )
git reset HEAD~1  undoes last commit
git log (list of commit)
get a key and 
git reset (key) unstages till then
